------ git -----
developer's tool 

our daily tasks...
create, save, edit and save again the tasks

doing versioning by timestamp

==> version control system 
-> about managing multiple versions of 
    documents, programs, websites, etc.
-> tracks history of collection of files.
-> version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.

why vcs (version contro software)

-> for individual help:
     -> gives you a time machine for going back to earlier versions.
     -> gives you great support for different versions (standalone, webapp,etc) of the same basic project.

-> for working with team
    -> great simplfies concurrent work , merging changes.

-> management of changes to file
    -> keep track of what changes occured.
    -> allows people to work together.


---- localized and centralized vcs -----------

-> a localized version control system keeps local copies of the files.
-> in centralized source control, there is a server and a client. The server is the master repository which contains all 
of the versions of the code.

-> centralized vcs ----------

-> in subversion, cvs, perforce, etc. A central server repository (repo) holds the official copy of the code.
     the server maintains the sole version history of the repo.

-> you make checkouts of it to your local copy  
     -> you make local modifications.
     -> your changes are not versioned

-> when you are done, you check in back to the server 
     -> your checkin increments the repo version.


=> drawbacks -----

-> both approaches have the drawback that they have one single point of failure.
-> in a localized version control systems it is the individual computer and 

-> in a centralized version control systems it is the server machine. 
   both system makes it also harder to work in parallel on different features. e.g. git, mercurial, etc,.


---- distributed version control systems ------------

-> in a distributed version control system each user has a complete local copy of a repository on his individual computer.

-> in git, mercurial, etc. you don't checkout from a central repo
    -> you clone it and pull changes from it.

-> your local repo is a complete copy of everything on the remote server 
    -> yours is just as good as theirs.

-> many operations are local 
     ->check in/out from local repo.
      -> commit changes to local repo.
      -> local repo keeps version history.

when you are ready you can push changes back to server.

=== git =====
-> git is a distributed version control system.
-> git is a tree history storage system.
-> git is content tracking management system.
it has ease and speed...


---git aur linux dono ke creator/founder linus trovalds hi hai..
he created git in 2005



---- installing git ---------

git keep track of file not directories....
git add .        yaha dot matlab current working directory......


---- local repository setup -----------

1. set the name and email for git to use when you commit 

git config --global user.name "akash gupta"
git config --global user.email "mailfromakashgupta@gmail.com"

step2 -> create a directory on github 

step3 -> initialize dir with
                git init

step4 -> create Readme.md file 
          -> git add (staging)
          -> git commit (local commit)

-------- remote repository -------

1. create remote repository on: 
     -> github, bitbucket, codecommit, etc.

2. clone repo to local 
     -> git clone url

3. local to remote integration 
    -> cd to local repo
   -> git remote add origin <https wala link>
   -> git branch -M main                       ab wo force nahi lagana padega and sahi jagah jayega bhi....
    -. git commit -m "code"
     -> git push -u origin main
      -> git pull -u origin main     (to fetch latest changes)




-> maan lo kisi file mai aapne change kiya and git pe update kar diya.....
then you can see the changes made in the terminal also ....


method 1

git log 
then 
git show <commit id>

method2

git log --oneline 
then 
git show <commit id>


last mai git pull bhi karke dekh liya.....

 
--------------

git config --global user.name 
        issey abhi kaun user local aur remote se connected hai wo pata lag jaega....

git config --global user.email
           uska email pata lag jaega...

git remote -v        command is used to display the urls of the remote repositories associated with your local git repo..
